# reactplate

Opinionated boilerplate for a fully configured quick start.

-   React + Redux
-   Jest + Enzyme testing
-   Hot reload with HMR and react-hot-loader
-   TypeScript support, parsed by Babel with @babel/preset-typescript
-   ESLint with @typescript-eslint, without TSLint

## TODO:

-   check build
-   check open:dist
-   check analyze build
-   check coverage
-   manifest.json with colors themes and stuff
-   favicon generated through webpack

## Ideas:

-   console spinner
-   https://github.com/addyosmani/critical
-   https://github.com/sweetalert2/sweetalert2
