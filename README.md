[reactplate-355203.netlify.app](https://reactplate-355203.netlify.app)

An opinionated React + Redux boilerplate for a fully configured quick start.

- React + Redux
- Vitest + React Testing Library
- Hot reload with HMR and react-hot-loader
- TypeScript support, parsed by Babel with @babel/preset-typescript
- ESLint with @typescript-eslint, without TSLint
- Great Visual Studio Code support, recommended extensions and workspace settings enabling all features
- SCSS modules with autocomplete and linting

### TODO:

- go back to react-helmet-async once it [supports React 19](https://github.com/staylor/react-helmet-async/issues/244)
- check redux reducers/actions hot reload
- manifest.json with colors themes
- favicon + phone icons?
