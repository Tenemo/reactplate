# reactplate

Boilerplate for a fully configured quick start.

-   React + Redux
-   Jest + Enzyme testing
-   Hot reload with HMR and react-hot-loader
-   TypeScript support, parsed by Babel with @babel/preset-typescript
-   ESLint with @typescript-eslint, without TSLint
-   Great Visual Studio Code support, recommended extensions and workspace settings enabling all features
-   Styled-components with autocomplete and linting

## TODO:

-   check redux reducers/actions hot reload
-   check build
-   check open:dist
-   check analyze build
-   check coverage
-   manifest.json with colors themes and stuff
-   favicon generated through webpack
-   add ErrorBoundary

## Ideas:

-   project-wide spinner component? use one from npm?
