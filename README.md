-   TypeScript support, parsed by Babel with @babel/preset-typescript
-   ESLint with @typescript-eslint, without TSLint

### TODO:

-   check redux reducers/actions hot reload
-   check coverage
-   manifest.json with colors themes
-   favicon + phone icons?

### Ideas:

-   project-wide spinner component? use one from npm?
