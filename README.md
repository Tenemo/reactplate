[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/26fb7e7c-f69d-40fa-b142-92a32d30b80f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/reactplate-tenemo/deploys)

A React + modern Redux (RTK) boilerplate for a fully configured quick start with automatic formatting and linting with ESLint & Prettier.

- Strict ESLint TypeScript linting and automatic formatting with zero additional configuration needed.
- VS Code settings bundled with the boilerplate, including recommended extensions for automatic formatting - via a one-click install.
- Optional [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) integration.
- Deployed to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) with an example catch-all redirect to always utilize react-router: [reactplate.com](https://reactplate.com)

The template follows best practices such as:

- semantic, accessible HTML,
- pre-connects to the API it uses,
- displays available system font when loading custom fonts,
- robot.txt included by default,

and many others. It scores perfect 100/100/100/100 score in Chrome Lighthouse. <br />

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >=20.11.0
- NPM (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Tenemo/reactplate.git
    cd reactplate
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create environment variables file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.sample .env
    ```
    Add your Sentry DSN in the .env file if you want error tracking. Otherwise, feel free to add your own environment variables or remove the .env handling altogether.

### Development

1. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will launch the application at http://localhost:3000 with hot reloading enabled.

2. Run tests:
    ```bash
    npm test  # Run tests once
    npm run test:watch # Run tests in watch mode
    npm run test:coverage # Generate test coverage report
    ```

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

To build without running linting and tests:

```bash
npm run build:skip
```

To analyze your bundle size:

```bash
npm run build:analyze
```

### VS Code

For the best development experience in VS Code install recommended VS Code extensions when prompted. All necessary configuration is already present in `.vscode/settings.json`
